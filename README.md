# QueT
A React Native mobile app to manage crowd at shops in COVID 19 pandemic. This app allows the shopkeeper to set a limit of customers per hour. Thus customers can book their slot and visit the shop. This app makes social distancing possible as shops are not overcrowded. Traditional queue can be implemented by this app. Users can stand in a queue digitally.

The motivation for this app comes from social distancing violations at wine shops all across India. Several people gathered at shops in long queues. Thus posing a health alert for COVID 19 local transmission.
