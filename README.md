# QueT
A React Native mobile app to manage crowd at shops in COVID 19 pandemic. This app allows the shopkeeper to set a limit of customers per hour. Thus customers can book their slot and visit the shop. This app makes social distancing possible as shops are not overcrowded. Traditional queue can be implemented by this app. Users can stand in a queue digitally.
